        <div class="story-card" data-title="The Little Red Hen"
        data-story="Once upon a time, on a sunny farm, there lived a little red hen. She had bright red feathers and a cheerful cluck. One day, while scratching in the dirt, she found some grains of wheat. 'Oh, what lovely grains!' she said. 'I can plant them and make bread.' She asked her friends, the lazy dog, the sleepy cat, and the duck who loved to swim, 'Will you help me plant these grains?' The dog said, 'Not I!' The cat said, 'Not I!' The duck said, 'Not I!' So the little red hen planted the grains all by herself. She watered them every day, and soon they grew into tall stalks of wheat. When it was time to harvest, she asked again, 'Will you help me cut the wheat?' The dog said, 'Not I!' The cat said, 'Not I!' The duck said, 'Not I!' So she cut the wheat herself. Then she asked, 'Will you help me take it to the mill to grind into flour?' Again, her friends said, 'Not I!' So she carried the wheat to the mill and got it ground into flour. Next, she asked, 'Will you help me bake the bread?' But once more, they refused. The little red hen baked the bread herself. When the bread was ready, it smelled so delicious that her friends came running. 'Will you share the bread with us?' they asked. But the little red hen said, 'No, I will not! I did all the work myself, so I will eat it all by myself.' And she did. From that day on, the little red hen learned that hard work always pays off, and she never asked her lazy friends for help again.">

        <div class="story-card" data-title="The Three Little Pigs"
        data-story="Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who left their mother's house to build homes of their own. The first little pig was very lazy. He built his house out of straw because it was quick and easy. 'This will do just fine,' he said. The second little pig was a bit smarter but still not very careful. He built his house out of sticks. 'This is stronger than straw,' he thought. The third little pig was wise and hardworking. He built his house out of bricks, even though it took much longer. 'I want a house that will last,' he said. One day, a big bad wolf came to the farm. He saw the first pig's straw house and knocked on the door. 'Little pig, little pig, let me come in!' he growled. 'Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!' said the pig. So the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The pig ran to his brother's stick house. The wolf followed and said, 'Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!' 'Not by the hair of our chinny chin chins!' they cried. The wolf huffed and puffed and blew the stick house down too. The two pigs ran to their brother's brick house. The wolf came and said, 'Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!' 'Not by the hair of our chinny chin chins!' they shouted. The wolf huffed and puffed with all his might, but he could not blow down the brick house. He tried again and again, but the house was too strong. Finally, the wolf gave up and went away. The three little pigs lived safely in the brick house, and they learned that it's important to plan ahead and build things that last.">

        <div class="story-card" data-title="Goldilocks and the Three Bears"
        data-story="In a big forest, there lived a family of three bears: a big papa bear, a medium-sized mama bear, and a little baby bear. One day, they went for a walk to let their porridge cool. While they were away, a curious girl named Goldilocks wandered into the woods. She had golden curls and was very adventurous. She saw the bears' cottage and knocked on the door, but no one answered. The door was unlocked, so she went inside. On the table, she saw three bowls of porridge. She tasted the big bowl. 'This porridge is too hot!' she said. She tasted the medium bowl. 'This porridge is too cold!' Then she tasted the little bowl. 'This porridge is just right!' she exclaimed, and she ate it all up. Next, Goldilocks saw three chairs. She sat in the big chair. 'This chair is too hard!' She sat in the medium chair. 'This chair is too soft!' She sat in the little chair. 'This chair is just right!' But when she leaned back, the chair broke. Tired from her adventure, Goldilocks went upstairs and saw three beds. She lay on the big bed. 'This bed is too hard!' She lay on the medium bed. 'This bed is too soft!' She lay on the little bed. 'This bed is just right!' And she fell fast asleep. Soon, the three bears came home. Papa bear looked at his bowl and growled, 'Someone has been eating my porridge!' Mama bear said, 'Someone has been eating my porridge!' Baby bear cried, 'Someone has eaten all my porridge!' Then they looked at the chairs. Papa bear said, 'Someone has been sitting in my chair!' Mama bear said, 'Someone has been sitting in my chair!' Baby bear wailed, 'Someone has broken my chair!' Upstairs, Papa bear said, 'Someone has been lying in my bed!' Mama bear said, 'Someone has been lying in my bed!' Baby bear shouted, 'Someone is still in my bed!' Goldilocks woke up and saw the three bears. She was so scared that she jumped out of bed and ran out of the house as fast as she could. She never went into strangers' houses again and learned to always respect others' things.">

        <div class="story-card" data-title="The Tortoise and the Hare"
        data-story="In a sunny meadow, there lived a speedy hare and a slow tortoise. The hare was very proud of how fast he could run. He would brag to all the animals, 'I am the fastest in the forest! No one can beat me!' The tortoise, with his heavy shell, moved very slowly. One day, the hare challenged the tortoise to a race. 'Let's race from the big oak tree to the river!' said the hare. All the animals gathered to watch. The tortoise accepted the challenge. 'I may be slow, but I will try my best,' he said. The race began. The hare zoomed ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. 'This is too easy!' laughed the hare. He ran so fast that he soon reached the halfway point. Seeing how far ahead he was, the hare decided to take a nap under a shady tree. 'The tortoise is so slow, I have plenty of time,' he thought. While the hare slept, the tortoise kept walking steadily, one step at a time. He didn't stop or rest. He just kept going, slow and steady. Hours passed. The hare woke up from his nap. 'Oh no! Where is the tortoise?' he exclaimed. He looked back and saw the tortoise was almost at the finish line. The hare ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. The tortoise crossed the river first and won the race. All the animals cheered for the tortoise. The hare learned that being overconfident can lead to failure, and that slow and steady wins the race. From then on, the hare was more humble, and the tortoise showed that perseverance pays off.">

        data-story="Once upon a time, on a farm, a mother duck hatched her eggs. All the ducklings were yellow and fluffy, except one who was gray and ugly. The other animals teased him and called him the ugly duckling. He felt sad and ran away from home. He wandered through the forest and met many animals, but none would be his friend because he was so ugly. Winter came, and the ugly duckling was cold and hungry. He found a pond and stayed there until spring. When the ice melted, he looked into the water and saw his reflection. But he wasn't ugly anymore! He had grown into a beautiful swan. The other swans welcomed him, and he realized that he had always been special, just different. From that day on, the swan lived happily with his new friends, knowing that true beauty comes from within.">

One day, the king invited everyone to a grand ball. Cinderella wanted to go, but her stepmother wouldn't let her. A fairy godmother appeared and gave Cinderella a beautiful dress, glass slippers, and a carriage made from a pumpkin. She warned Cinderella to be home by midnight. At the ball, Cinderella danced with the prince, but when the clock struck midnight, she ran away, leaving one glass slipper behind. The prince searched the kingdom for the girl who fit the slipper. When he found Cinderella, they married and lived happily ever after. Cinderella learned that kindness and goodness always win in the end.">
